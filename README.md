A Contact Management System  is a simple command-line application that allows users to manage a list of contacts efficiently. It provides functionalities to add, search, update, delete, and view all stored contacts. This project uses basic file I/O operations to store contacts persistently in a file, so the data remains available even after the program is closed.
Add Contact: Allows users to input a new contact's name, phone number, and email address and save them.
Search Contact: Allows users to search for an existing contact by name and view their details.
Update Contact: Users can update the phone number or email address of an existing contact.
Delete Contact: Enables the removal of a contact by name.
Display All Contacts: Lists all contacts stored in the system with their details (name, phone, and email).
Exit: Allows users to exit the application.
